</code_context>

<issue_to_address>
**suggestion:** export_chunk does not handle file write errors or permission issues.

Catch OSError during file operations and raise a more descriptive error, such as WAVError, to handle unwritable paths or disk full scenarios.

+    def export_audio_data(self, output_path: Union[str, Path]) -> int:
</code_context>

<issue_to_address>
**suggestion:** export_audio_data duplicates logic from export_chunk; consider refactoring.

Refactor export_audio_data to use export_chunk for file writing to avoid duplication and simplify maintenance.

**suggestion (testing):** Consider adding a test for export_audio_data with a file that has no data chunk.

Adding a test for files missing the data chunk will help confirm that export_audio_data correctly handles and reports this error case.

Suggested implementation:

```python
    def test_export_audio_data_various_formats(self, tmp_path):
        """Test export_audio_data with various audio formats."""
        from tests.conftest import create_wav_file

        test_cases = [
            ('mono_8bit', {'channels': 1, 'bits_per_sample': 8, 'num_samples': 1000}),
            ('stereo_16bit', {'channels': 2, 'bits_per_sample': 16, 'num_samples': 1000}),
            ('mono_24bit', {'channels': 1, 'bits_per_sample': 24, 'num_samples': 1000}),
        ]

        for name, params in test_cases:
            wav_file = tmp_path / f"{name}.wav"
            wav_info = create_wav_file(wav_file, **params)

            parser = WAVParser(wav_file)
            parser.parse()

            output_file = tmp_path / f"{name}_audio.bin"
            bytes_written = parser.export_audio_data(output_file)

            assert bytes_written == wav_info['data_size']
            assert output_file.exists()

    def test_export_audio_data_no_data_chunk(self, tmp_path):
        """Test export_audio_data with a WAV file missing the data chunk."""
        import wave
        import pytest

        # Create a minimal WAV file with only the header, no data chunk
        wav_file = tmp_path / "no_data_chunk.wav"
        with wave.open(str(wav_file), 'wb') as wf:
            wf.setnchannels(1)
            wf.setsampwidth(2)
            wf.setframerate(44100)
            # Do not write any frames, so no data chunk

        parser = WAVParser(wav_file)
        parser.parse()

        output_file = tmp_path / "no_data_audio.bin"
        import pytest
        with pytest.raises((ValueError, RuntimeError, KeyError)):
            parser.export_audio_data(output_file)

```

- If `WAVParser` raises a specific exception for missing data chunk, replace `(ValueError, RuntimeError, KeyError)` with the correct exception type.
- If you have a utility for creating WAV files without a data chunk, use that instead of the manual `wave` module code.
- Ensure `pytest` is imported at the top of the file if not already present.

**suggestion (code-quality):** Replace if-expression with `or` ([`or-if-exp-identity`](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Reference/Rules-and-In-Line-Suggestions/Python/Default-Rules/or-if-exp-identity))

<br/><details><summary>Explanation</summary>Here we find ourselves setting a value if it evaluates to `True`, and otherwise
using a default.

The 'After' case is a bit easier to read and avoids the duplication of
`input_currency`.

It works because the left-hand side is evaluated first. If it evaluates to
true then `currency` will be set to this and the right-hand side will not be
evaluated. If it evaluates to false the right-hand side will be evaluated and
`currency` will be set to `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`.

**issue (code-quality):** Avoid loops in tests. ([`no-loop-in-tests`](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Reference/Rules-and-In-Line-Suggestions/Python/Default-Rules/no-loop-in-tests))

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>Avoid complex code, like loops, in test functions.

Google's software engineering guidelines says:
"Clear tests are trivially correct upon inspection"
To reach that avoid complex code in tests:
* loops
* conditionals

Some ways to fix this:

* Use parametrized tests to get rid of the loop.
* Move the complex logic into helpers.
* Move the complex part into pytest fixtures.

> Complexity is most often introduced in the form of logic. Logic is defined via the imperative parts of programming languages such as operators, loops, and conditionals. When a piece of code contains logic, you need to do a bit of mental computation to determine its result instead of just reading it off of the screen. It doesn't take much logic to make a test more difficult to reason about.

* loops
* conditionals

Some ways to fix this:

* Use parametrized tests to get rid of the loop.
* Move the complex logic into helpers.
* Move the complex part into pytest fixtures.

> Complexity is most often introduced in the form of logic. Logic is defined via the imperative parts of programming languages such as operators, loops, and conditionals. When a piece of code contains logic, you need to do a bit of mental computation to determine its result instead of just reading it off of the screen. It doesn't take much logic to make a test more difficult to reason about.

**issue (code-quality):** Don't import test modules. ([`dont-import-test-modules`](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Reference/Rules-and-In-Line-Suggestions/Python/Default-Rules/dont-import-test-modules))

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>Don't import test modules.

Tests should be self-contained and don't depend on each other.

If a helper function is used by multiple tests,
define it in a helper module,
instead of importing one test from the other.

**issue (code-quality):** Avoid loops in tests. ([`no-loop-in-tests`](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Reference/Rules-and-In-Line-Suggestions/Python/Default-Rules/no-loop-in-tests))

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>Avoid complex code, like loops, in test functions.

Google's software engineering guidelines says:
"Clear tests are trivially correct upon inspection"
To reach that avoid complex code in tests:
* loops
* conditionals

Some ways to fix this:

* Use parametrized tests to get rid of the loop.
* Move the complex logic into helpers.
* Move the complex part into pytest fixtures.
